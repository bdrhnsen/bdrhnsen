## 🚀 Key Projects

### 🔹 Automated Highway Driving  
- Developed a **custom highway simulation** compatible with OpenAI Gym to train RL agents for **lane-change decision-making** and **speed optimization**.  
- Designed and implemented a **polynomial trajectory planner** and an **MPC-based trajectory follower** for smooth and collision-free driving.  
- Used **ROS2** for system communication and closed-loop autonomous driving in a dynamic driving simulator.
- Project is still under development and soon will be open-source 

### 🔹 [Automated Gym Environment Ros Node Converter](https://github.com/bdrhnsen/Auto-Ros-Node-From-Gym)
- Developed a framework for automatically generating ROS2 nodes from Gymnasium environments.
- This project enables to usage of Gymnasium or OpenAIGym type environments to be used in ROS directly.
