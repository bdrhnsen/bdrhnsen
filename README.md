# Hello, I'm Bedirhan Sen!  

🔧 **Robotics and Control Engineer**

I'm a soon to be master's graduate in **Systems and Automation** from RWTH Aachen University, with a strong focus on **robotics**, **control systems** and **machine learning**. My passion lies in designing, implementing, and optimizing advanced algorithms for real-world autonomous systems.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 🔹 [Highway Simulation](https://github.com/bdrhnsen/HighwaySimulation)  
- Developed a **custom highway simulation** compatible with OpenAI Gym to train RL agents for **lane-change decision-making** and **speed optimization**.  
- Designed and implemented a **polynomial trajectory planner** and an **MPC-based trajectory follower** for smooth and collision-free driving.  
- Used **ROS2** for system communication and closed-loop autonomous driving in a dynamic driving simulator.
- Project is still under development and soon will be open-source 

### 🔹 [Automated Gym Environment Ros Node Converter](https://github.com/bdrhnsen/Auto-Ros-Node-From-Gym)
- Developed a framework for automatically generating ROS2 nodes from Gymnasium environments.
- This project enables to usage of Gymnasium or OpenAIGym type environments to be used in ROS directly.

### 🔹 [Reinforcement Learning Action Probability and Reward Visualizer](https://github.com/bdrhnsen/rl_visualizer)
- Works with StableBaselines3 and Gymanisum. Goal is to visualize action probabilities and rewards.

### 🔹 [Ros2 demo udp message sender and receiver](https://github.com/bdrhnsen/Ros2Udp)
- This repository contains two ROS 2 nodes designed for UDP communication. These nodes facilitate data exchange between systems using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The implementation includes a listener node (ros2_udp_listener) and a sender node (ros2_udp_sender).
